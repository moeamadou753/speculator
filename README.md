## Idea
Speculation indicator — from the prime mortgage crisis of the 2000’s to the crash of Tesla stock over speculation that delivery centres would be closed in China due to coronavirus, its no secret that much of what drives stock prices is purely emotional and not backed by facts. This is supported by the idea that the increase in the price of stocks is termed “speculation” and that a key determinant of stock prices is expectations for those stock prices according to elementary financial theory. We can do better in 2020. This web-app will use sentiment analysis (NLP) and scrape twitter and a selection of news sources to create a holistic view of a company’s financial health (statement of financials, comprehensive income, return on equity), PESTLE relevance, and fitness of management, from which it will discern whether or not the company’s stock is currently experience a bearish or bullish bubble, with % likelihood estimates. This will also be supplemented by training ML models using the Berkshire Hathaway repository of historic stock data.
