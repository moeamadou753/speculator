// Import all of your SCSS files to this file.
// The reason for this practise is because CSS styling is applied globally, so it only needs to be referenced (either directly or indirectly)
// once.

// Example:
@import "./App.scss"; // @import "App", @import "./App" would also work.
@import "./globalVariables";
